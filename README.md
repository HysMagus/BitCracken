#BitCracken
##Cracking insecure BTC private keys with a large amount of words.

###About:
This small bash script will crack ALOT of Bitcoin private keys that are insecure. It uses a word-pattern technique that allows it to work. It has a list of weak passwords included, however with a few changes to 'Crack.sh' you're able to change it. Then, this will hash the password into a private key.

###How to use. (In Ubuntu, atleast.)
Just type './cracken.sh' to run the program under Ubuntu 16.04 and Linux Mint.
