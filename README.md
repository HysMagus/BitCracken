#BitCracken
##Cracking insecure BTC private keys with a frick'n fridgeload of words.

###About:
This small bash script will crack ALOT of Bitcoin private keys that are insecure. It uses a word-pattern technique that allows it to work. It has a list of weak passwords included, however with a few changes to 'Crack.sh' you're able to change it. Then, this will hash the password into a private key.

###Why did you make this, you evilton!?!
Jeez. I just made this for laughs and giggles. I don't intend anyone doing any harm with this. Besides, people who have bad security should pay the price for their laziness. (that is, if legal in your area. :D)

###How to use. (In Ubuntu, atleast.)
Just type './cracken.sh' to run the program under Ubuntu 16.04 and Linux Mint.
